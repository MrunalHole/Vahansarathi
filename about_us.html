             <p>
                Our system is designed to develop vehicle tracking system with advanced features. It  provides the new way to keep eye on vehicles.  Fingerprint verification of driver/ user is provided with the anti-theft security to the vehicle. Our system is connected with any vehicle and uses vehicleâ€™s power backup (battery). GPS module provides the live location of vehicles at any time anywhere even though vehicle will not be running. Also, it is be used for parental control by using live trace of vehicle and speed.
                Our system represents considerable authority in the development security strategies.
                The vehicle tracking system monitors the live location of the vehicles even though the vehicle is at steady. Likewise, it keeps the history of the tracks and journeys for additional investigation.
                The counter anti-theft security is given like driver of vehicle is confirmed by his/her fingerprints. For fingerprint confirmation the details-based calculation is utilized alongside optical unique fingerprint scanner. On the off chance that the driver is confirmed with the put away information inside the database, the vehicle will start and if various endeavours are done to check identity and system couldn't check the identity, system sends alert messages to the proprietor of the vehicle. Alert message is sent utilizing on chip sim card or can be send utilizing SMS API from server side. All information is put on server as opposed to putting away it on motherboard (Raspberry Pi) to save from information misfortune in the event of system/equipment failure.
